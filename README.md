# Go Unfloc Yourself

## Description

A bundle for Symfony 5 that adds a `Permissions-Policy` header in all the
responses to prevent the use of new Google's "*Federated Learning of Cohorts*"
tracking method, namely [FLoC][46].

Basically, it adds a specific header to every response to disable Google's usage
of your site in it's FLoC tracking method.

For better performance, it is advised to edit the `.htaccess` or alter the
webserver configuration.

## Features

If an existing `Permissions-Policy` header is found, the bundle will not change
that value.

The added headers is: `Permissions-Policy: interest-cohort=()`

## Installation

```composer require loophp/go-unfloc-yourself-bundle```

## Usage

Once installed, there is nothing else to do.

## Code quality, tests and benchmarks

Every time changes are introduced into the library, [Github][2] run the
tests.

The library has tests written with [PHPSpec][35].
Feel free to check them out in the `spec` directory. Run `composer phpspec` to
trigger the tests.

Before each commit some inspections are executed with [GrumPHP][36], run
`composer grumphp` to check manually.

The quality of the tests is tested with [Infection][37] a PHP Mutation testing
framework,  run `composer infection` to try it.

Static analyzers are also controlling the code. [PHPStan][38] and
[PSalm][39] are enabled to their maximum level.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by sending Github pull requests. I'm quite reactive :-)

If you can't contribute to the code, you can also sponsor me on [Github][5] or
[Paypal][6].

See [CHANGELOG.md][43] for a changelog based on [git commits][44].
